* persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy is a string not a list
* apiVersion of pv and pvc is v1 not apps/v1
* pvc.spec.resources.requests.storage is 250 MB , but in pv it was 250Mi. Both are different units.
    modify the pvc to Mi to solve this problem.
* Inconsitent Indentations.
* In deployment templates it have wrong spec called containers.images but actually it was containers.image.
